                    <h2>SKYLAR GELNETT</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website. This is a hub for all of my projects and experience. 
                        My name is Skylar Gelnett, and I am currently a student at the University of Pittsburgh. 
                        I am a Junior studying Media and Professional Communications on the Digital Media track, I am passionate about exploring the vast 
                        and ever-changing landscape of media and communication. Through my coursework, I have developed a strong 
                        foundation in various forms of media, including social media, journalism, and advertising,
                        and have honed my skills in writing, research, and critical thinking. I am also constantly
                        seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in the field. With
                        my strong work ethic, attention to detail, and enthusiasm for learning, I am confident 
                        that I have the skills and drive to excel in any media-related role. Through my coursework I have developed many projects that showcase my wide variety of skills.
